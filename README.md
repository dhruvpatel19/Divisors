# Divisors

The 2 styles of programs are presented in this repository:

1. Get a list of every single divisor of N, then find the length of the list containing each divisor.

2. Get the prime factorization of N, use the exponents of each prime factor, add 1, and multiply them all together to get total number of divisors.
